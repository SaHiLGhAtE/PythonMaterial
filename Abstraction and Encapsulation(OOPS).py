# Abstraction and Encapsulation
# Abstraction-abstraction is like a part of something for eg.a programmer makes
# just a part of game like a player,by himself only and something other is made
# by another programmer.

# Encapsulation-encapsulation is hiding details from the user of how it works.
# for eg. a normal user don't know how a laptop actually works from inside like how cpu works
# and what is the use of gpu when there is cpu.
